Present: Chau Cat Bui and Lucas Matthews.
Meeting Time: November 22nd, 2022. 14 minutes.

* Lucas continued making new datas for our project.
* Last time, we talked about how we should change the videos from percentage into number of counts and Lucas fixed it.
* He made 5 new charts for our project.
* Lucas first made the number of comments per trending days. They're almost identical to number of days trending to videos.
* He also made a graph that shows the number of mean comments after days of published of trending videos.
* He made a graph that has the standard deviation of the number of comments per video.
* He also made a graph that sees what time the video is published in the day.
* He made a graph that shows the average number of views by posting in the time of the day. There's not a lot of clear
correlation that we see here.
* Cat managed to post some graphs along with some information about each graphs described in the website.
* Cat uses the json files and import them accordingly to the graph.
* With all the graphs Lucas made, Cat will finish up posting all the graphs up onto the website.
* Lucas will work on putting logging to our assignment.
* Cat will work on creating presentation for us to do since Cat does most of the frontend work.
