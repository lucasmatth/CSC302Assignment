Present: Chau Cat Bui and Lucas Matthews.
Meeting Time: November 15th, 2022. 9 minutes.

* All of the stuff that was going to be done is done now.
* Lucas finished making his data and Cat has rough drafts on the website and where to put datas in.
* Lucas created time_trending analysis
* Lucas created a plot graph and he decides to keep some outliers to the right because the graph looks good already.
* He will continue to find other datas that we wrote in Documention&RoadmapA2 where he will look into how comment counts 
affect view counts.
* Cat has worked on making the frontend page look better and posted some graphs there.
* Cat will continue on now using Lucas's data and display frontend neatly.
