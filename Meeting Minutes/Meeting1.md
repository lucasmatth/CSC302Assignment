Present: Chau Cat Bui and Lucas Matthews.
Meeting Time: October 9th, 2022. 1 hour 5 minutes.

* We first talk about planning our schedule. 
* Cat can usually do in the mornings and Lucas works in the weekends.
* Weekly meetings will be at 11 AM on Tuesday.
* Talked about tech stack options.
* We can use Python for frontend/backend.
* We want to settle for Python.
* We also talk about SQL and how that is the best tool for organizing data. We would like to incorporate SQl with Python.
* Python is the easiest option that we can do, since we have only 2 people and our goal isn't about making our product look appealing. The most important thing is to get the results.
* Because our group members are only 2 and we don't have a lot of time, we want our implementation to be more simple.
* Microsoft Excel is brought up briefly but is shot down due to Excel being too simplistic.
* We also pick HTTML as our front-end development tool.
* HTML allows us to store data offline, which is prevalent for our datasets.
* HTML excells at connecting to different links and web pages, which is good for us to display the result
using multitude of links.
* HTML is a widely used language, which makes its tech support high.
* HTML is also a relatively simple tool to use in regards to develop techs.
* We've considered React but we opt not to, since React is complicated and it's known to evolve too much, thus it has terrible documentation power.


Expertise:
* Cat has 4 courses and has a part-time job.
* Lucas has 3 courses and has a part-time job. 
* Cat and Lucas have experience with Python and C. 
* Lucas has done internship and use Django.
* Cat has some Typescript knowledge. Cat expresses his inexperience since he hasn't done internship.


Dataset:
* Discussed about datasets and talked about the fields we are interested in: gaming, YouTube, TikTok, crime and housing sales.
* We settle on YouTube trending datasets, since a lot of us consume YouTube on a very regular basis.
* One of our question is about determining whether publish time in a day affects the view count and how much so, since 
some people are more active at a certain time of day than others. 
* We will also examine the relationship between comment counts and view counts or like counts. This is because we know
some videos have insane number of views but they barely get any comments.
