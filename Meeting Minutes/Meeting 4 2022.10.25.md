Present: Chau Cat Bui and Lucas Matthews.
Meeting Time: October 25th, 2022. 15 minutes.

* We were both really busy last week due to midterm season, and therefore did not get much notable done
* Decided to set some goals and have them done for the weekend where we will have a more in depth meeting

For Luke:
* finish setting up CICD
* How long it takes for a video to go from published to trending
* From there see if I can break the data into groups by something like quick medium and long periods between publish to trending and see the differences in comments and likes

For Bui:
* Print a pyplot in html
