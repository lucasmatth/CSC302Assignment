Present: Chau Cat Bui and Lucas Matthews.
Meeting Time: October 18th, 2022. 15 minutes.

* Discuss what the goal is again.
* We decide on first trying a bunch of queries to see what good datas we want to display is.
* Next week, we will work on displaying at least one good data on the page.
* We have two choices to make: we either build a framework and write codes in Python to find the datas we think are interesting or we just use SQL, query them and graph it to see if our data is interesting.
* We find the second choice to be more efficient. We would not have to spend so much time finding datas only to by the end
say that this data is uninteresting. 
* But we also find the first choice to be necessary since we need to have produced some amount of codes and datas at a
certain deadline.
* In the end, we choose the second choice since we value efficiency.
