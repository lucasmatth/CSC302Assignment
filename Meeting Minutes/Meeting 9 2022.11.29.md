Present: Chau Cat Bui and Lucas Matthews.
Meeting Time: November 29nd, 2022. 10 minutes.

* Lucas had to fix up his database because it was flawed and inconsistent throughout
* He talked about how some csv files use different words for the word "False" for example.
* There were some duplicate videos throughout the database.
* The database that we grabbed was really faulty.
* Thus, because Luca needed to work on this, he didn't have time to do logging.
* This week, Lucas will work on logging.
* Cat has finished uploading all the images in the website.
* Cat also described what the datas mean in the website as well.
* He will work on making the website looks better.
* Cat will also form a presentation for us to do.
* We plan to meet on Friday 2pm to talk more about our work.
* We discuss about how we will present. We plan to do online. This is because Cat likes doing online, and Lucas doesn't have a laptop.
