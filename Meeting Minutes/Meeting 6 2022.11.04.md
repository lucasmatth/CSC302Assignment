* Lucas still has the struggle of datas being too spread out and we work on fixing it.

* We then review Week 7 video regarding Blameless Postmorterm to write for Assignment 2.
* We reviewed the Documentation and Roadmap documents and discussed our Milestones and what we achieved.
* We haven't finished the milestone we said where October 23, we want to extrapolate all our data.
* But we've made some progress towards Milestone 2 where we created some kind of website that's possible.
* We also talked about how having a due date on November 21 is way too late for our Milestone 3.
* We talked about how our Roadmaps were done kind of poorly.
* We also talked about how our approach to this project is sort of simple.
