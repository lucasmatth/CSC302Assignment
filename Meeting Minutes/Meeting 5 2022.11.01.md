Present: Chau Cat Bui and Lucas Matthews.
Meeting Time: November 1st, 2022. 11 minutes.

* Luke did what he said he would do from last week.
* Luke finished setting up CI/CD.
* Luke checked data to see how long it takes to go from published to trending.
* One problem he encountered was that he doubled the database so when he graphed it his data looked really off.
* His bar graph had problems so he didn't push it because he encountered troubles with it.
* Luke's goal for this week is to fix his bar graphs and data necessary.
* Luke will continue expanding on making more datas.
* 
* Cat hasn't done anything for this week. He said it's because he had 3 tests and an assignment for this week
but he said he will work hard this week and finish up the things necessary for frontend.
* Cat's goal for this week is to work on frontend, create containers so that we can put datas necessary into it.
* Creating containers like this will help us not to worry too much about frontends while still producing necessary
data for our project.
* Cat has only set up html working code but hasn't done anything more than that.
* 
* Since our A2 is due on Friday and we hope to makae it due on Sunday, we will meet on Friday at 4pm to reconvene
and finish for Assignment 2.
