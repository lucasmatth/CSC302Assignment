Documentation and Roadmap

1. 
We decided Python for most of our coding. This is because Python is the simplest application we can use. Since we 
have 2 people that has considerable amount of work outside, we think Python would help us handle our workload. We
considered the flaw of using Python which is that it might not be as strong a tool as other programming languages
like C++ that excells at handling memories, but we think Python should be sufficient to complete our project. Python
also has a lot of support and tech options that we can rely on. Python is the most simple language to use as well.

We consider HTML as a good tool to use. This is because HTML is known for being good with linking to other pages.
As we deal with datasets, we think that it's beneficial for us to be able to display different results in different pages.
HTML is also simple to use and both of us have very few experience with frontend development, so we want to 
pick HTML as our guiding technology. We thought about using JavaScript since Cat has worked on it, and JavaScript allows
websites to look better and more dynamic. But we know that JavaScript is complicated to use and since we have 2 people who are rather new to front-end development, we want to go for HTML. We can also make graphs using pyplot and upload the picture into our website.

Both HTML and Python have long-lived projects that works for them. They both have good amount of support and have
relative ease of use, so we decide to work with these two.

In our team, Cat doesn't have internship experience and feels inadequate about working in projects due to his past
experiences. Both Cat and Lucas have part-time jobs and have 3-4 courses. Lucas excells at Python and Django. Cat has
handled a little bit about Typescript and is good with Python and C. Cat can usually work in the day on the weekdays and Lucas can work Tuesday and Wednesday, so we decide to have our meeting on Tueday at 11 AM.

2. 
By October 23, we want to develop a program that can extrapolate our data wanted and query it selectively. 
By November 11, we want to obtain results based on the metrics that we wanted. By this time, we will also create a website that will upload the information from our data to website in whatever manner. 
By November 21, we want to be able to graph this in pyplot accordingly. Then, we continue on developing the front-end component.
By Nobember 28, we will finish polishing up our website to make it look good and the user interacts well with it with the information desired.

Hopefully, we can derive our work so that Lucas does backend work while Cat does frontend work, although we will mostly
help each other along the way. We will strive to communciate and push each other to work on each components. 

The next action that we will do is that we will upload the data into our working folder. We will then write a program that read to differentiate between different variables across the data and store them into some lists. We will also get started on writing functions that can gather all of one type and gather information, such as comparing each view counts to an average number of views and determine which videos have more views than the others by the time of day.
