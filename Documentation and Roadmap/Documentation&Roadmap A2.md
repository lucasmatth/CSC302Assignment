Documentation and Roadmap

1. 
We decided Python for most of our coding. This is because Python is the simplest application we can use. Since we 
have 2 people that has considerable amount of work outside, we think Python would help us handle our workload. We
considered the flaw of using Python which is that it might not be as strong a tool as other programming languages
like C++ that excells at handling memories, but we think Python should be sufficient to complete our project. Python
also has a lot of support and tech options that we can rely on. Python is the most simple language to use as well.

We consider HTML as a good tool to use. This is because HTML is known for being good with linking to other pages.
As we deal with datasets, we think that it's beneficial for us to be able to display different results in different pages.
HTML is also simple to use and both of us have very few experience with frontend development, so we want to 
pick HTML as our guiding technology. We thought about using JavaScript since Cat has worked on it, and JavaScript allows
websites to look better and more dynamic. But we know that JavaScript is complicated to use and since we have 2 people who are rather new to front-end development, we want to go for HTML. We can also make graphs using pyplot and upload the picture into our website.

Both HTML and Python have long-lived projects that works for them. They both have good amount of support and have
relative ease of use, so we decide to work with these two.

In our team, Cat doesn't have internship experience and feels inadequate about working in projects due to his past
experiences. Both Cat and Lucas have part-time jobs and have 3-4 courses. Lucas excells at Python and Django. Cat has
handled a little bit about Typescript and is good with Python and C. Cat can usually work in the day on the weekdays and Lucas can work Tuesday and Wednesday, so we decide to have our meeting on Tueday at 11 AM.

2. 
November 7:
    - Lucas should be done at least 1 set of data with some graphs included so that Cat can start working on making the front end display it properly.
    - Cat is blocked on Lucas so he will do some research on how Django interacts with custom HTML pages to be used for display instead of the build in pages
November 14:
    - Cat displays data on page.
    - Lucas adds more sets of data at least one of the ones outlined in A1
November 21:
    - In this week ideally we will be both adding new datas to our databank to be displayed
    - However we also would like to leave this week as a bit of a flex week because we are unsure if we will need to put more work into the front end display and make it look better or if we can solely focus on increasing the data we are showing
November 28:
    - We are unsure of the course timeline and are not sure what day Assignment 3 will be due but:
    - Since this is the end of the semester this week will be for tying up anything that needs to be tied. We should have a project worthy of presentation by this date.
3. 
The datasets that we will use is YouTube Trending Videos in 2017-2018. We choose this because we consume YouTube videos in an unhealthy manner daily so we are wondering whether the time of day pertains to an increase number of views. We also want to see how much does comment counts increase in relation to view counts and compare that with like counts as well. We are curious about whether high number of comments in videos correlate more to increase of views or to increase of likes/dislikes number. Along the way, we will also probably find more information that's worth mentioning.

Adding onto this for Assignment 2. We thought it would be really interesting to show if there was any difference between the time it took for videos to be trending. Like for example the difference in number of comments between a video that trended after 1 day versus a video that trended after 100 days.
