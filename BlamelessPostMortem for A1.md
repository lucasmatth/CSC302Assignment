Since the submission of Assignment 1 we have shifted the weekly goals that we had set. 

Originally we had planned to get the backend with the data analysis set up and then both do our best to make it look pretty for presentation in the front end. But what actually ended up happening is we split the workload where Lucas was working on curating the database and learning how to manipulate it while Cat setup the html landing page for the eventual display of youtube data. So instead of going strictly from back to front end we are developing both concurrently. I believe the reason this change happened was because Lucas just preposed to do it in this different way and there were no objections. 

We think that even though we changed the ordering of what was in the roadmap we believe we are still on track to have something to show for the end of the semester. Infact in some ways we are ahead of our timeline.

This brings me to one critique that we have identified and it is that we believe we may have made the scope of the project too small. Since we are only a 2 man group with not as much experience as some of our classmates we were hesitant to really push ourselfs and it is now very clear looking back that this was an error as we now know we have underestimated our skills.

So because of this we are looking to change our roadmap from Assignment 1 so that it more accurately depicts what needs to be completed and also we can try and push ourselfs a bit more to have a better product by the end of the semester.
