      This graph represents the number of days that videos trend. As we can see here, most videos trend for at least one day before it declines rapidly. We can also expect to see that there are many outliers in this graph, which means there are many videos that surpasses the amount of times the majority of trending videos trend.

      This graph and the previous share similar resemblance. Trending videos usually trend on the first day, thus the number of comments that appears are also on the first day.

      By examining these two graphs together, we can see a very strong correlation between the number of days videos trend to the number of comments that gets posted.

      The word mean means average. This means the average number of comments that appears on trending videos happens on day 33 with it reaching to about 62,000 comments on its videos. This is to be expected since for our previous graph, we see that the number of comments reach 10,000,000 on day 1. And since our graph has many outliers to the right, the average comments would then be somewhere around the number 30.

      We can see a rather similar correlation between this graph and the previous graph. This graph peaks in view counts on the day 1 with 3 billion views. We can learn usually that a video that trends usually gather views the most on the first day.

    <p>
      In the first 40 days, it seems to have a rather high view counts. It's quite interesting that this graph is a more flat than the other counts like comments and likes/dislikes. This could be because some videos that trends for a long time are able to amass so much views that it would make the graph look a lot more even than it should be.
