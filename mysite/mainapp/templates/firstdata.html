  <h1>The First Data</h1>
  <p>This data represents the percentage of videos that trends in how many amount of days. </p>
  <p>
    Note that our database consists of only trending videos. Thus, the bar of 0 indicates that the video trends on the same day that it's released.
  </p>

  <p>
  The x-axis is the number of days between published time and trending time.
  </p>
  <p>
  The y-axis is the percentage of videos that trends.
  </p>
  <p>The reason why we don't use number of videos instead is because we couldn't scale the y-axis down efficiently</p>
